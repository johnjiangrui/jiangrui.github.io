This is totally empty content of this article. You are wasting your time reading this test sample articles. I wrote it for testing purpose. It gives me fun when I coding with javascript and VIM. That\`s very cool feeling. I don\`t know why. I just couldn\`t give up on coding. Worrying about too much does\`t give me any progress on anything. Now I know the reality: who TM cares!
